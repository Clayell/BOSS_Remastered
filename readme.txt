BOSS
Bolt On Screenshot System

Important
Using this mod requires alot of ram. Thus burst fire mode is restricted to no supersampling. Although you can still use supersampling when not using burst fire.
I recommend not going higher than 3 or 4.

Description
This plugin allows you to take screenshots within KSP at a higher resolution than your current screen resolution, using a technique called 'supersampling'. 
Press 'z' to take a screenshot(default) and 'p' to hide the UI.
